# Diffusion Computation
Lecture-1A  [Diffusion model with analytic solution](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/alvason/diffusion-computation/blob/master/diffusion-analytic.ipynb)
In a physical intuitive vision, an analytic solution is a crystal clear way for measuring the true. 
   
During numerical computation development, an analytic solution is one of the corner stones for checking the precision and efficiency of numerical algorithm.
